This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone it, fork it or download it..

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Build it

```bash
npm run build
```

Why does the build fail with Error: useSessionStorage is a client-only hook

Run dev

```bash
npm run dev
```

We get an internal server error on each request although it loads and sets data in the session
